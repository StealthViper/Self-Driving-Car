# Self-Driving-Car
A simple Self Driving Car created using Behavioral Cloning

Model inspired by the NVIDIA model proposed for self driving cars. Trained in Google Colab and tested in the open-source Udacity Simulator.

Self-driving cars have rapidly become one of the most transformative technologies to emerge. Fuelled by Deep Learning algorithms, they are continuously driving our society forward and creating new opportunities in the mobility sector.

Here is the video of the simulation:
